<h1>What is the Pepsi Dog Donation Fund?</h1>

<p> The Pepsi Donation Fund is dedicated to donating Pepsi to dogs who love Pepsi with just the click of a button. We noticed there was a lack of Pepsi as it was being pushed out by evil Coca-Cola and the Pepsi dogs were getting sad because there was no Pepsi. So, we created this donation fund so we can get these poor dogs Pepsi to make them happy again.</p>
